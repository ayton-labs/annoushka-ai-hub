## Getting Started

### I've never used AI. Where do I start?
Start with [AI 101: The Basics](/getting-started/ai-101-basics), then follow the [First Week Guide](/getting-started/first-week-guide). You'll be up and running in less than an hour!

### How much time will this actually save me?
Typical time savings:
- **Email drafting**: 50-70% faster
- **Document summaries**: 60-80% faster
- **Report writing**: 40-60% faster
- **Research**: 60-80% faster
- **Content creation**: 50-70% faster

These savings compound over time as you get better at prompting.

### Is this hard to learn?
No! If you can use Google search, you can use AI. Basic use is very intuitive. Advanced techniques come with practice, but you'll get value from day one.

### What if I don't know what to ask?
Browse our [Prompt Library](/prompts/overview) - we have 200+ pre-written prompts for common tasks. Just copy, customize, and use!

## Security & Privacy

### Is it safe to use AI at work?
Yes! We use ChatGPT's company accounts, which means:
- Your conversations **don't train the AI models**
- Enhanced security features
- Enterprise-grade privacy

But still use common sense about what you share.

### What shouldn't I share with AI?
**Don't share**:
- Customer personal information (names, emails, addresses)
- Complete financial accounts or detailed financial data
- Passwords or login credentials
- Confidential supplier contracts (exact terms and pricing)
- Unreleased product details before launch
- Personal employee information

### What's safe to share?
**Do share**:
- Anonymized examples ("A customer who loves lockets...")
- Public information (competitor websites, published articles)
- Your work drafts (emails, copy, documents)
- General scenarios and process questions
- Aggregated data without identifiers

### How do I know if something is safe to share?
**Simple rule**: Ask yourself "Would I email this to someone outside the company?"
- If **no** → Don't put it in ChatGPT
- If **yes** → Generally fine to use

See the [Prompt Writing Guide](/getting-started/prompt-writing-guide) for detailed security examples.

## Using AI Effectively

### Why are my results so generic?
**Vague prompts = vague results.**

Be specific with:
- Who you are and your context
- What you need (task and goal)
- Details that matter (length, tone, format)
- Who the audience is

See [Prompt Writing Guide](/getting-started/prompt-writing-guide) for examples.

### Can AI make mistakes?
**Yes!** AI can:
- Make factual errors (especially with recent info)
- "Hallucinate" (make things up confidently)
- Miss nuance or context
- Get calculations wrong

**Always review outputs**, especially facts, figures, and anything consequential.

### How do I maintain Annoushka's brand voice?
1. **Provide context in prompts**: "I'm writing for Annoushka, a luxury jewellery brand known for craftsmanship..."
2. **Specify tone**: "Warm but sophisticated", "Celebrates craft and meaning"
3. **Review carefully**: Does this sound like us?
4. **Iterate**: "Make it more sophisticated" / "Less salesy, more meaningful"
5. **Add your touch**: Final polish is always human

### The first result isn't good enough. What do I do?
**Iterate!** AI gets better with feedback:
- "Make this 30% shorter"
- "Use simpler language"
- "Add more emphasis on craftsmanship"
- "Try a warmer tone"
- "Give me 5 more options"

Think of it as a conversation, not a one-shot request.

### What's the difference between ChatGPT and Claude?

- **ChatGPT**: Faster, more widely used, great for most tasks

Start with ChatGPT (you have company access). Explore Claude later if curious.

## Getting More Value

### How do I go from basic to advanced?
1. **Start simple**: Use pre-made prompts from the library
2. **Customize**: Adapt prompts to your specific needs
3. **Learn**: Read [Prompt Writing Guide](/getting-started/prompt-writing-guide)
4. **Go deeper**: Try [Deep Research Guide](/guides/deep-research)
5. **Experiment**: Try new use cases and share what works!

### What's the biggest mistake people make?
**Being too vague.**

"Help me with marketing" → Generic, useless response
"I'm planning a Mother's Day campaign for our locket collection. Give me 10 email subject lines emphasizing sentimental value..." → Specific, useful response

**Remember**: Shit in = Shit out. Quality of input determines quality of output.

### Can I request new prompts or guides?
**Yes!** If you need a prompt or guide that doesn't exist:
- Contact Ollie
- Post in [team channel]
- We'll add it to the hub!
