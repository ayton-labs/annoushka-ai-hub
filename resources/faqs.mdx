## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I've never used AI. Where do I start?">
    Start with [AI 101: The Basics](/getting-started/ai-101-basics), then follow the [First Week Guide](/getting-started/first-week-guide). You'll be up and running in less than an hour!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much time will this actually save me?">
    Typical time savings:
    - **Email drafting**: 50-70% faster
    - **Document summaries**: 60-80% faster
    - **Report writing**: 40-60% faster
    - **Research**: 60-80% faster
    - **Content creation**: 50-70% faster

    These savings compound over time as you get better at prompting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this hard to learn?">
    No! If you can use Google search, you can use AI. Basic use is very intuitive. Advanced techniques come with practice, but you'll get value from day one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't know what to ask?">
    Browse our [Prompt Library](/prompts/overview) - we have 200+ pre-written prompts for common tasks. Just copy, customize, and use!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security & Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is it safe to use AI at work?">
    Yes! We use ChatGPT's company accounts, which means:
    - Your conversations **don't train the AI models**
    - Enhanced security features
    - Enterprise-grade privacy

    But still use common sense about what you share.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What shouldn't I share with AI?">
    **Don't share**:
    - Customer personal information (names, emails, addresses)
    - Complete financial accounts or detailed financial data
    - Passwords or login credentials
    - Confidential supplier contracts (exact terms and pricing)
    - Unreleased product details before launch
    - Personal employee information
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's safe to share?">
    **Do share**:
    - Anonymized examples ("A customer who loves lockets...")
    - Public information (competitor websites, published articles)
    - Your work drafts (emails, copy, documents)
    - General scenarios and process questions
    - Aggregated data without identifiers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know if something is safe to share?">
    **Simple rule**: Ask yourself "Would I email this to someone outside the company?"
    - If **no** → Don't put it in ChatGPT
    - If **yes** → Generally fine to use

    See the [Prompt Writing Guide](/getting-started/prompt-writing-guide) for detailed security examples.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using AI Effectively

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are my results so generic?">
    **Vague prompts = vague results.**

    Be specific with:
    - Who you are and your context
    - What you need (task and goal)
    - Details that matter (length, tone, format)
    - Who the audience is

    See [Prompt Writing Guide](/getting-started/prompt-writing-guide) for examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can AI make mistakes?">
    **Yes!** AI can:
    - Make factual errors (especially with recent info)
    - "Hallucinate" (make things up confidently)
    - Miss nuance or context
    - Get calculations wrong

    **Always review outputs**, especially facts, figures, and anything consequential.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I maintain Annoushka's brand voice?">
    1. **Provide context in prompts**: "I'm writing for Annoushka, a luxury jewellery brand known for craftsmanship..."
    2. **Specify tone**: "Warm but sophisticated", "Celebrates craft and meaning"
    3. **Review carefully**: Does this sound like us?
    4. **Iterate**: "Make it more sophisticated" / "Less salesy, more meaningful"
    5. **Add your touch**: Final polish is always human
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The first result isn't good enough. What do I do?">
    **Iterate!** AI gets better with feedback:
    - "Make this 30% shorter"
    - "Use simpler language"
    - "Add more emphasis on craftsmanship"
    - "Try a warmer tone"
    - "Give me 5 more options"

    Think of it as a conversation, not a one-shot request.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting More Value

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I go from basic to advanced?">
    1. **Start simple**: Use pre-made prompts from the library

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the biggest mistake people make?">
