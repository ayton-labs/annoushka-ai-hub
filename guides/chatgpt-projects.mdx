</Frame>

The process is simple:
1. **Hype your copilot** - Identify the task you want to automate
2. **Onboard your copilot** - Create a Project with instructions and files
3. **Kick off an initiative** - Test it with real work
4. **Put your copilot to work** - Use it regularly and refine

## What Are ChatGPT Projects?

**A ChatGPT Project is a dedicated workspace where you can:**
- Upload files (brand guidelines, product catalogs, reports) that ChatGPT remembers
- Set custom instructions that apply to every conversation
- Keep all related chats organized in one place
- Share Projects with team members for consistency

**The difference:**
- **Regular ChatGPT**: Starts fresh every conversation, no memory
- **ChatGPT Project**: Remembers your files, preferences, and context automatically

---

## Why Use Projects at Annoushka?

### 1. Maintain Brand Voice Automatically
Upload brand guidelines once. Every piece of content matches Annoushka's tone without repeating yourself.

**Example**: Marketing team uploads brand voice guide → all social captions, emails, and copy automatically sound like Annoushka.

### 2. Save Time on Repetitive Tasks
Set instructions once, use forever. No more copying the same context into every prompt.

**Example**: Merchandising uploads stock file format → all future analysis follows the same structure without re-explaining.

### 3. Build Institutional Knowledge
Store documents, SOPs, and context that ChatGPT references automatically.

**Example**: Product team uploads past collection briefs → new designs reference historical context and patterns.

## Pro Tips for Better Projects

### 1. Start Specific, Not Generic
❌ Bad: "Marketing Helper"
✅ Good: "Instagram Caption & Story Creator"

**Why:** Specific Projects give better, more consistent results.

### 2. Upload Examples of Good Work
Include 2-3 examples of content you love. ChatGPT will learn your style.

**Example:** Upload your 3 best-performing Instagram posts → future captions match that quality.

### 3. Update Files Regularly
Add new examples, remove outdated information. Keep Projects current.

**Example:** Add new product launches, update pricing, refresh brand guidelines.

### 4. Use One Project Per Major Task
Don't create "General Work Helper" - create:
- "Weekly Reports"
- "Email Drafting"
- "Research & Analysis"

### 5. Share with Team Members
Projects can be shared. One person sets it up, whole team benefits.

**Example:** Marketing lead creates "Brand Content Creator" → entire team uses same brand voice.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Making Instructions Too Long
Keep custom instructions under 500 words. Be specific but concise.

**Fix:** Focus on the 3-5 most important guidelines, not everything.

### ❌ Uploading Too Many Files
More files ≠ better results. Upload only what's essential.

**Fix:** Start with 3-5 key documents. Add more only if needed.

### ❌ Using Generic Project Names
"Project 1" and "Marketing Stuff" are impossible to find later.

**Fix:** Name it for the task: "Product Description Writer" or "Sales Report Analyzer"

### ❌ Never Updating Projects
Projects get stale if you don't refresh uploaded files and instructions.

**Fix:** Review quarterly. Update files, refine instructions based on what works.

### ❌ Treating Projects Like Magic
Projects are powerful but still need good prompts within each chat.

**Fix:** Projects handle context; you still need to be specific in your requests.

## When to Use Projects vs. Regular ChatGPT

### Use a Project When:
✅ You do this task regularly (weekly or more)
✅ You need consistent output/style
✅ You have files that provide important context
✅ Multiple conversations need the same background
✅ You're sharing with team members

### Use Regular ChatGPT When:
✅ One-off random questions
✅ Quick clarifications
✅ Testing ideas
✅ Personal tasks unrelated to work
✅ No need for consistent format

---

## Sharing Projects with Your Team

### How to Share:
1. Open your Project
2. Click the share icon (top right)
3. Add team members by email
4. Set permissions (can edit / can view)

### What They Can Do:
- **Can Edit:** Add files, modify instructions, create chats
- **Can View:** Use the Project, see files, can't change settings

### Best Practices:
- One person "owns" the Project (keeps it updated)
- Team uses it consistently
- Regular reviews to improve
- Share learnings in team channel

**Example:** Marketing lead owns "Brand Content" Project → entire marketing team uses same brand voice automatically.

---

## Measuring Success

### How to Know If Your Project Is Working:

**Time saved:**
- Before: 30 min per task
- After: 10 min per task
- **Saved: 20 min per task**

**Quality improved:**
- Fewer revisions needed
- More consistent output

## Real Success Stories

**After:** "Social Content" Project maintains voice. Posts take 5 min instead of 20.
**Result:** 75% time saved. Better brand consistency.

### Merchandising
**Before:** Weekly stock analysis took 3 hours. Manual Excel work.
**After:** "Stock Analyzer" Project produces insights in 15 min.
**Result:** 2.5 hours saved weekly. Better recommendations.

### Customer Service
**Before:** Drafting complaint responses took 15-20 min each. Varied quality.
**After:** "CS Response Helper" provides draft in 2 min. Team refines.
**Result:** 3x more responses handled. Higher customer satisfaction.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "ChatGPT isn't using my uploaded files"
**Fix:** Explicitly mention the file in your prompt: "Using the brand guidelines file..."

### "Responses don't match my style"
**Fix:** Add 3 examples of your best work to the Project. ChatGPT will learn from them.

### "Instructions are being ignored"
**Fix:** Make instructions shorter and more specific. Prioritize the 3-5 most important rules.

### "I have too many Projects"
**Fix:** Consolidate. Merge similar Projects. Archive ones you haven't used in 2 months.

### "Team isn't using shared Projects"
**Fix:** Show them one great example. Make it stupidly easy. Celebrate early wins.
