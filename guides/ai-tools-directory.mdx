## Common Questions

### "Do I need all these tools?"
**No.** Start with ChatGPT. Add others only when you have a specific need ChatGPT doesn't solve.

### "Which tool should I pay for first?"
**ChatGPT Plus.** It's the most versatile and you'll use it daily. Everything else can start on free tiers.

### "Can I use the free versions?"
**Yes.** Free tiers are surprisingly capable. Only upgrade when you hit limits.

### "What if I'm overwhelmed?"
**Just use ChatGPT.** Seriously. One tool, mastered, is better than seven tools barely used.

### "Which tool is best for my role?"
- **Marketing/Social:** ChatGPT + Canva
- **Merchandising/Ops:** ChatGPT + NotebookLM
- **Product/Design:** ChatGPT + Midjourney
- **Retail/CS:** ChatGPT + Otter.ai
- **Everyone:** Start with just ChatGPT

---

## What We Didn't Include (And Why)

**Tools we left out:**
- Copy.ai, Jasper, Writer → ChatGPT does this now
- Notion AI → Most people don't use Notion
- Microsoft Copilot → Not widely available yet
- Coding tools → Not relevant for most roles
- 50 other AI tools → They're too niche

**Philosophy:** Better to master 3 tools than dabble with 20.
