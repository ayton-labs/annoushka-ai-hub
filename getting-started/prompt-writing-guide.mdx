## The Golden Rule: Shit IN = Shit OUT

**The single most important thing to understand about AI:**

If you give it vague, lazy prompts → You get generic, useless results

If you give it detailed, thoughtful prompts → You get excellent, tailored results

**It's that simple.** The quality of what you put in determines the quality of what you get out.

Think of AI like a brilliant assistant who:
- Knows everything but nothing about YOUR specific situation
- Can do anything but needs clear instructions
- Works fast but can't read your mind

**Your job**: Provide the context, details, and specifics that make the output useful.

---

## The Golden Formula

```
[Role/Context] + [Task] + [Specifics] + [Format/Tone] = Effective Prompt
```

### Breaking It Down

**Role/Context**: Who you are and the situation
- "I'm the Marketing Manager at Annoushka, a luxury jewellery brand."
- "I'm preparing for a board meeting about Q4 performance."

**Task**: What you want AI to do
- "Write an email..."
- "Analyze this data..."
- "Create a list of..."
- "Summarize this document..."

**Specifics**: Details that matter
- Length (words, paragraphs)
- Key points to include
- What to avoid
- Target audience

**Format/Tone**: How it should be delivered
- Tone: professional, warm, formal, conversational
- Format: bullet points, paragraph, table, email
- Style: concise, detailed, creative, analytical

## Examples: Bad vs Good

<Tip>
**See it in action:** Watch how a simple change in prompt structure transforms results from generic to exceptional. Seeing the difference live is more convincing than reading about it.

### Example 1: Email Writing

❌ **Bad Prompt**:
```
Write an email about the sale
```

✅ **Good Prompt**:
```
I'm the Marketing Manager at Annoushka, a luxury jewellery brand. Write a 150-word email to our VIP customer list announcing our Summer Charms event. Include:
- Exclusive preview access (June 1-3)
- 20% off all charm bracelets
- Personal styling appointments available
- Emphasis on limited pieces and craftsmanship

Tone should be warm and exclusive (not pushy or salesy). Make them feel special for being VIPs.
```

**Why it's better**: Clear context, specific details, defined length, tone guidance.

---

### Example 2: Data Analysis

❌ **Bad Prompt**:
```
Look at this data
```

✅ **Good Prompt**:
```
I'm the Merchandising Manager. Analyze this sales data from Q1 and:
1. Identify top 5 performing product categories
2. Highlight any concerning trends
3. Compare performance to same period last year
4. Suggest 3 actionable insights for Q2 planning

Format as an executive summary (max 300 words) with bullet points for key findings.

[paste data]
```

**Why it's better**: Specific analytical tasks, clear output format, actionable focus.

---

### Example 3: Content Creation

❌ **Bad Prompt**:
```
Write about jewellery
```

✅ **Good Prompt**:
```
I'm the Social Media Manager for Annoushka. Write an Instagram caption (150 chars max) for our new Rainbow Locket collection.

Key points:
- Colored gemstones (sapphires, emeralds, rubies)
- Represents joy and optimism
- Locket holds photos of loved ones
- Handcrafted in London

Tone: Warm, sophisticated, emphasis on emotional connection and craftsmanship. Include 5 relevant hashtags.
```

**Why it's better**: Platform specified, character limit, key messages, tone, format requirements.

## The Six Principles of Great Prompts

### 1. Be Specific

**Vague**: "Help me with marketing"
**Specific**: "Create 5 email subject lines for our Mother's Day campaign targeting customers who bought lockets in the past"

### 2. Provide Context

**No context**: "Write a report"
**With context**: "I'm presenting to the CEO about retail performance. Write a 1-page executive summary of these store metrics highlighting successes and areas for improvement"

### 3. Define the Output

**Undefined**: "Analyze this"
**Defined**: "Create a table with 3 columns: Finding, Impact, Recommendation"

### 4. Set Constraints

**Unconstrained**: "Write an email"
**Constrained**: "Write a 100-word email. Keep it under 3 paragraphs. Don't mention pricing."

### 5. Specify Tone

**No tone**: "Respond to this complaint"
**With tone**: "Respond with empathy and professionalism, acknowledging the frustration without being defensive"

### 6. Use Examples (When Helpful)

```
Write 3 product descriptions in this style:

EXAMPLE:
"The Classic Gold Locket - A timeless treasure to hold your most precious memories. Handcrafted in 18ct gold with space for two photographs. £850"

Now write for: [your products]
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Chain of Thought
Ask AI to think step-by-step.

```
Before giving your final answer, think through:
1. What are the key customer needs?
2. What makes this product unique?
3. How does it compare to competitors?

Then write the product positioning statement.
```

### Technique 2: Role Playing
Make AI adopt a specific perspective.

```
You are an expert luxury retail consultant with 20 years experience. Review this customer journey and identify friction points.
```

### Technique 3: Multiple Options
Ask for variations to choose from.

```
Give me 5 different versions of this headline, ranging from conservative to bold.
```

### Technique 4: Iterative Refinement
Build on previous responses.

```
Prompt 1: "Draft an email about..."
Prompt 2: "Make it 30% shorter"
Prompt 3: "Add more emphasis on craftsmanship"
Prompt 4: "Perfect. Now create a subject line."
```

### Technique 5: Templates
Create reusable prompt structures.

```
I need a [type of content] for [audience] about [topic].

Key messages:
- [point 1]
- [point 2]
- [point 3]

Tone: [tone]
Length: [length]
Format: [format]
```

<Tip>
**The Voice Method: The Easiest Way to Prompt**

Instead of typing, press the **Voice Mode** button in ChatGPT (the headphone/waveform icon) and simply speak to it like a colleague.

<Frame caption="Watch the Voice Mode full-circle trick - speak naturally and let AI help you craft the perfect prompt">
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID_HERE?hide_share=true&hideEmbedTopBar=true"
    className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
    frameBorder="0"
    allowFullScreen
    title="Voice Mode Full-Circle Method Demonstration"
  ></iframe>
</Frame>

Speaking is faster, more natural, and helps you convey nuance and context that's harder to type. You can even use the "full-circle method" to design better prompts by speaking.

**Example:**
> "I am trying to build a marketing plan for Annoushka — can you help me write a prompt for that?"

The AI will then generate a clear, structured prompt for you. You can refine it together through conversation before running the final version.

**Why it works**: Speaking lets you think aloud, express tone and emotion, and course-correct mid-sentence. It's like brainstorming with a creative partner instead of typing instructions.

Try it — your prompts will improve instantly.

## Troubleshooting: When Results Are Bad

### Problem: Output is too generic
**Solution**: Add more specific details and context

### Problem: Wrong tone
**Solution**: Be explicit: "Use a warm, conversational tone" or "Keep it formal and professional"

### Problem: Too long/short
**Solution**: Specify exact length: "100 words" or "3 bullet points" or "1 paragraph"

### Problem: Missing key information
**Solution**: List must-include points explicitly

### Problem: Factually incorrect
**Solution**: AI isn't reliable for facts. Always verify or provide the facts yourself

### Problem: Doesn't sound like "us"
**Solution**: Provide examples of your brand voice or specific phrases to use/avoid

---

## The Iteration Mindset

**Remember**: First outputs are drafts, not finals.

**Iteration examples**:
- "Make this more concise"
- "Use simpler language"
- "Add more detail about [topic]"
- "Remove the section about [topic]"
- "Make it sound more [adjective]"
- "Rewrite the opening to be more engaging"
- "Give me 3 alternative versions"

---

## Prompt Templates for Common Tasks

### Template: Professional Email
```
I'm [your role] at Annoushka. Write a [length] email to [recipient] about [topic].

Include:
- [key point 1]
- [key point 2]
- [key point 3]

Tone: [tone]
Call to action: [action]
```

### Template: Content Summarization

Summarize this [document type] in [format]:
- Key points only

[Specific task]
[Details about content]
[Length/format requirements]
[Tone guidance]
```

## Security & Privacy: What to Share (and Not Share)

### ✅ Your Company Account is Protected

**Good news**: We use ChatGPT's company accounts which means:
- **Your conversations don't train the AI models** - Your inputs stay private
- **Enhanced security features** - Better protections than free accounts
- **Enterprise-grade privacy** - Designed for business use

**In simple terms**: OpenAI (the company that makes ChatGPT) doesn't use what you type to improve their AI for other people.

---

### ⚠️ Still Think Twice Before Sharing

**Even with company accounts, use common sense:**

**DON'T share**:
- Complete financial accounts or detailed financial data
- Customer personal information (names, emails, addresses, payment details)
- Passwords, API keys, or login credentials
- Confidential supplier contracts (specifics)
- Unreleased product plans or pricing strategies (pre-launch)
- Personal employee information (salaries, performance reviews)

**DO feel free to share**:
- Anonymized or example data ("Here's a sample sales report structure")
- Public information (competitor websites, published articles)
- General scenarios ("A customer is unhappy about a delay...")
- Your own work drafts (emails, copy, documents)
- Aggregated data without specific identifiers
- Process questions and workflow descriptions

---

### 🛡️ Simple Security Rules

**Rule 1: Remove names and identifying details**
- Instead of: "Sarah Johnson bought £5,000 of jewellery"
- Use: "A customer bought £5,000 of jewellery"

**Rule 2: Use representative examples**
- Instead of: [uploading actual supplier contract]
- Use: "I have a supplier contract with these key sections: [list]. Help me summarize..."

**Rule 3: Ask yourself: "Would I email this to someone outside the company?"**
- If no → Don't put it in ChatGPT
- If yes → Generally fine to use

**Rule 4: When in doubt, ask**
- Check with Ollie or your manager
- Better safe than sorry

### 💡 How to Use AI Safely and Effectively

**For Financial Analysis**:
❌ Don't upload: "Annoushka Q4 2024 Full P&L.xlsx"
✅ Do this: "I have sales data showing a 15% increase in lockets but 10% decrease in earrings. Help me analyze what might be driving this and what actions to consider."

**For Customer Communications**:
❌ Don't share: "Customer Jane Smith (jane@email.com) is unhappy about order #12345"
✅ Do this: "A VIP customer's repair is delayed by 2 weeks. Help me draft an apology email offering a gesture of goodwill."

**For Supplier/Contract Review**:
❌ Don't upload: Full contract with pricing and terms
✅ Do this: "I'm reviewing a supplier contract. The key terms are [summarize without specific numbers]. What questions should I be asking?"

**For Product Development**:
❌ Don't share: "Our exact costs and margins for new Zodiac collection"
✅ Do this: "We're developing a zodiac-themed collection. Help me research current market trends and competitor offerings."

---

### 🎯 The Balance: Security + Utility

**Remember**: AI is most useful when you give it detail and context.

The goal is to give AI enough information to help you, without sharing sensitive data.

**Good practice**:
- Focus on the structure and type of problem, not confidential specifics
- Use ranges instead of exact numbers when possible
- Anonymize examples
- Think "representative scenario" not "actual case"

**If you need to work with truly sensitive data**: Do the analysis elsewhere, then use AI to help format, explain, or present the findings.

---

## Quick Reference Card

**Before every prompt, ask yourself**:
1. ✅ Have I explained who I am and why this matters?
2. ✅ Is my task crystal clear?
3. ✅ Have I specified length/format?
4. ✅ Have I defined the tone?
5. ✅ Have I mentioned any constraints?
6. ✅ Will AI have all the information it needs?
7. ✅ Am I sharing anything confidential that I shouldn't?

## Next Steps

1. **Practice** with 5 different types of prompts
2. **Save** your best prompts as templates
3. **Share** effective prompts with your team
4. **Experiment** with advanced techniques
5. **Refine** based on results

---

**Remember**:
- Great prompting is a skill that improves with practice
- Shit in = Shit out: More detail and context = Better results
- Stay smart about security, but don't let it stop you from using AI effectively

Every expert started where you are now.
