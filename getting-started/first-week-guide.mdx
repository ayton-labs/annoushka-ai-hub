## Day 1: Your First Conversation

### Goal
Get comfortable with the interface and have your first successful AI interaction.

### Tasks (15 minutes)

1. **Log in to ChatGPT**
   - Navigate to chat.openai.com
   - Use your company credentials
   - Take a moment to look around the interface

2. **Start a Conversation**
   - Click "New Chat" in the top left
   - Type: "Explain what you are and how you can help me in my work"
   - Read the response

3. **Try Your First Real Task**
   - Pick something simple from your actual work
   - Example prompts:
     - "Summarize these meeting notes: [paste notes]"
     - "Give me 5 subject lines for an email about [topic]"
     - "Create a checklist for [task you do regularly]"

4. **Experiment with Iteration**
   - If you like the result → great!
   - If not → ask for changes:
     - "Make it shorter"
     - "Use a more professional tone"
     - "Give me 5 more options"

### Success Metric
You've had a back-and-forth conversation with ChatGPT and gotten a useful output.

## Day 2: Understand Good Prompts

### Goal
Learn what makes a prompt effective.

### Tasks (15 minutes)

1. **Try a Vague Prompt**
   - Type: "Write an email"
   - Notice the generic result

2. **Try a Detailed Prompt**
   - Type: "I'm the [your role] at Annoushka, a luxury jewellery brand. Write a 100-word email to a customer whose repair is taking longer than expected. Be empathetic and reassuring, and offer a small gesture of goodwill. Use a warm but professional tone."
   - Compare the results

3. **Read the Prompt Writing Guide**
   - Open [Prompt Writing Guide](./prompt_writing_guide.md)
   - Skim the key principles
   - Bookmark for reference

4. **Practice the Formula**
   ```
   [Role/Context] + [Task] + [Specifics] + [Tone/Style] = Good Prompt
   ```

### Success Metric
You understand why detailed prompts get better results.

## Day 3: Solve a Real Problem

### Goal
Use AI for an actual work task that would normally take you 30+ minutes.

### Tasks (15-30 minutes)

1. **Identify Your Task**
   - Pick something from today's to-do list
   - Ideas:
     - Draft an email

     - Analyze data

2. **Write Your Prompt**
   - Include context about who you are
   - Be specific about what you need
   - Mention any constraints (length, tone, format)

3. **Iterate to Perfection**
   - First result probably won't be perfect
   - Ask for adjustments
   - Refine until it's 90% there
   - Add your final human touch

4. **Compare Time**
   - How long did this take vs. doing it manually?
   - Would it be faster next time?

### Success Metric
You've used AI to complete a real work task and saved time.

## Day 4: Explore the Prompt Library

### Goal
Discover pre-written prompts for your department.

### Tasks (15 minutes)

1. **Find Your Department's Prompts**
   - Go to AI Hub → Prompt Library
   - Open your department's prompt file
   - Browse the available prompts

2. **Test 3 Prompts**
   - Pick 3 that seem useful
   - Try them with your own information
   - Bookmark or save the ones that work

3. **Adapt a Prompt**
   - Take one prompt and modify it for your specific situation
   - Save the modified version for future use

4. **Share a Win**
   - If something worked well, tell a colleague!

### Success Metric
You have 3 "go-to" prompts saved for common tasks.

## Day 5: Learn What AI Can't Do

### Goal
Understand AI's limitations to avoid frustration.

### Tasks (15 minutes)

1. **Test the Boundaries**
   - Ask about very recent events (last 24 hours)
   - Notice AI may not have current information
   - Ask a math-heavy question
   - Notice AI can make calculation errors

2. **Practice Verification**
   - Ask AI to write something with specific facts
   - Check those facts independently
   - Notice where AI might "hallucinate" (make things up)

3. **Read Guidelines**
   - Open [When to Use (and Not Use) AI](./guidelines/when_to_use.md)
   - Understand the boundaries
   - Read [Privacy & Security Guidelines](./guidelines/privacy_security.md)

### Success Metric
You know when to trust AI and when to verify.

## Weekend: Reflect & Plan

### Goal
Consolidate your learning and plan next steps.

### Tasks (10 minutes)

1. **Reflect**
   - What worked well this week?
   - What task saved you the most time?
   - What's still confusing?

2. **Identify 3 Regular Use Cases**
   - What tasks do you do weekly that AI could help with?

## Troubleshooting

**"I don't know what to ask"**
→ Start with the Prompt Library or browse Use Cases

**"The results aren't good"**
→ Add more context and be more specific in your prompt

**"This isn't saving me time"**
→ Keep practicing - prompting is a skill that improves quickly

**"I'm not sure if I should use AI for this"**
→ Check the Guidelines or ask Ollie

**"It's making factual errors"**
→ Always verify facts. Use AI for drafting, not final truth
