## What is AI?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is technology that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence - like understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.

For your work, the most relevant type is **Generative AI** - AI that can create new content (text, images, ideas) based on your instructions.

## The Tools You'll Use

### ChatGPT (Primary Tool)
- Created by OpenAI
- Best for: Writing, analysis, problem-solving, research
- You have a company account with enhanced features
- Available on desktop and mobile

### Other Tools You Might Encounter
- **Claude** (by Anthropic) - Similar to ChatGPT, good for detailed analysis
- **Midjourney/DALL-E** - For image generation
- **Perplexity** - For research with sources
- **Custom GPTs** - Specialized versions we'll build for specific tasks

---

## How Does It Work?

Think of AI like a very knowledgeable assistant who:
- Has read millions of documents
- Can write in any style you need
- Works 24/7 and never gets tired
- Responds in seconds

**But remember**:
- It doesn't truly "understand" like humans do
- It can make mistakes (especially with facts and math)
- It needs clear instructions to give good results
- You're always in control and make the final decisions

## Key Concepts

### 1. Prompts
A **prompt** is your instruction to the AI - what you want it to do.

**Bad prompt**: "Write about jewellery"
**Good prompt**: "Write a 100-word Instagram caption for our new Locket collection, emphasizing the sentimental value of keeping loved ones close. Use a warm, sophisticated tone."

### 2. Context
The more context you give, the better the result.

**Include**:
- Your role
- Your audience
- Your goal
- Any constraints (length, tone, format)

**Example**: "I'm the Marketing Manager at Annoushka, a luxury jewellery brand. Write an email to our VIP customers announcing our summer sale. Keep it exclusive-feeling, not pushy. Around 150 words."

### 3. Iteration
First results are rarely perfect. Think of AI as a conversation:
1. Give initial prompt
2. Review the result
3. Ask for changes: "Make it shorter" / "More formal" / "Add emphasis on craftsmanship"
4. Repeat until perfect

### 4. Human Judgment
AI is a tool, not a decision-maker.

**Always**:
- Review AI outputs for accuracy
- Apply your expertise and judgment
- Check for brand voice alignment
- Verify facts and figures
- Make final editorial decisions

## Security & Privacy (Important!)

### Your company account is protected
- **Your conversations don't train the AI** - Your inputs stay private
- Better security than free accounts
- Designed for business use

### But still use common sense

**DON'T share**:
- Complete financial accounts
- Customer personal info (names, emails, addresses)
- Passwords or login credentials
- Confidential supplier contracts (exact terms)
- Personal employee information

**DO feel free to share**:
- Anonymized examples ("A customer ordered £5000 of jewellery")
- Public information (competitor websites, articles)
- Your work drafts (emails, copy, documents)
- General scenarios and process questions

**Simple rule**: Ask yourself "Would I email this to someone outside the company?"
- If no → Don't put it in ChatGPT
- If yes → Generally fine

**See the [Prompt Writing Guide](./prompt_writing_guide.md) for detailed security examples.**

## Common Questions

**"Will this replace my job?"**
No. AI handles the tedious parts of your job so you can focus on the creative, strategic, and relationship-building work that humans do best.

**"What if I don't know what to ask?"**
Start with our Prompt Library - pre-written prompts for common tasks. Adapt them to your needs.

**"What if the results are bad?"**
That's normal at first! Prompting is a skill. The more you practice, the better you'll get. And remember - you can always ask AI to revise.

**"Is this hard to learn?"**
If you can use Google search, you can use AI. Basic use is very intuitive. Advanced techniques come with practice.

**"How much time will this actually save?"**
Depends on the task, but typically:
- Email drafting: 50-70% faster
- Report writing: 40-60% faster
- Research: 60-80% faster
- Brainstorming: 2-3x more ideas in same time

**"Is it safe to use?"**
Yes, with your company account. Just don't share customer data or highly confidential information. Use anonymized examples instead.
