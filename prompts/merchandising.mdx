## Merchandising-Specific Tips

### When Working with Data
- **Be specific about time periods** - WoW, MoM, YoY all mean different things
- **Provide context** - is this seasonal? Is there a trend? Any market factors?
- **Ask for multiple scenarios** - conservative, base, optimistic
- **Request confidence levels** - where is AI speculating vs analyzing?

### When Planning Buys
- **Share historical performance** - AI can spot patterns you might miss
- **Use AI for sense-checking** - second opinion on your thinking
- **Model scenarios** - AI is great at "what if" analysis
- **Don't trust forecasts blindly** - use as input, not gospel

### When Creating SOPs
- **Start with your informal process** - tell AI how it works now
- **Ask for improvements** - AI can spot gaps or inefficiencies
- **Get multiple versions** - detailed for training, quick for reference
- **Test with your team** - make sure it actually makes sense

### When Communicating with Suppliers
- **Be specific about tone needed** - firm vs collaborative makes a difference
- **Include relationship context** - long-term partner vs new supplier
- **State your goal** - improve performance vs escalate issue vs maintain relationship
- **Review carefully** - you're representing Annoushka

## Security Reminder for Merchandising

**DON'T share**:
- Complete financial P&Ls with exact margins
- Specific supplier pricing and contract terms
- Exact customer purchase data with names
- Unreleased product details before launch

**DO share**:
- Aggregated sales trends and patterns
- Anonymized performance data
- General process flows and structures
- Representative scenarios and examples

**When analyzing data**: Use ranges, percentages, and anonymized examples rather than exact figures when possible.
