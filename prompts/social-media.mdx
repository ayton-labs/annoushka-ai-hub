4. **Paste into ChatGPT** and send

6. **Iterate if needed** - "make it warmer" / "shorter" / "more sophisticated"
7. **Add your human touch** - final polish, personality, brand-specific language

---

## Social-Specific Tips

### For Captions
- **Always provide visual context** - what's in the image/video matters
- **Be specific about tone** - "warm but sophisticated" vs "playful but luxurious"
- **Include CTA strategy** - what do you want people to do?
- **Request hashtag variations** - AI can suggest discovery tags you might not think of

### For Video Scripts
- **Specify platform** - TikTok vs Reels have different energy
- **Give time constraints** - 15 sec vs 60 sec dramatically changes script
- **Describe visual sequence** - what shows when in the video
- **Request hook options** - first 3 seconds are critical

### For Community Management
- **Create template libraries** - faster response times
- **Build in personalization points** - where to customize each template
- **Include escalation guidelines** - when to escalate vs handle
- **Review periodically** - update templates based on new questions/situations

### Maintaining Brand Voice
- **Reference tone**: Sophisticated, warm, craftsmanship-focused, meaningful
- **Avoid**: Cheap/salesy language, excessive emojis, generic influencer speak
- **Emphasize**: Handcrafted quality, British heritage, personal meaning, lasting value
- **Check every output**: Does this sound like Annoushka?

---

## Security Reminder for Social
