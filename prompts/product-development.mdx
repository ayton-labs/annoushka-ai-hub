## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Copy the relevant prompt** for your design/development task
2. **Fill in specific details** - collection names, materials, timelines
3. **Add Annoushka context** - brand values, quality standards, aesthetic
4. **Paste into ChatGPT** and generate
5. **Review critically** - AI doesn't understand luxury craft like you do
6. **Iterate** - refine outputs to match Annoushka standards
7. **Apply human judgment** - especially for creative and strategic decisions

---

## Product-Specific Tips

### When Researching Trends
- **Be specific about timeframe** - trends move fast
- **Focus on luxury segment** - mass market trends may not translate
- **Filter through brand lens** - not all trends fit Annoushka
- **Look beyond jewellery** - fashion, art, culture all influence design

### When Developing Collections
- **Start with story** - meaning and craft should drive design
- **Balance art and commerce** - beautiful but must sell
- **Think portfolio** - how does this fit our overall range?
- **Consider operations** - can we actually make this at quality?

### When Creating Briefs
- **Be specific** - vague briefs get vague results
- **Include examples** - reference points clarify vision
- **Set clear parameters** - budget, timeline, constraints
- **Leave room for creativity** - brief should guide not limit

### When Working with Suppliers
- **Communicate standards clearly** - quality is non-negotiable
- **Build relationships** - best suppliers are partners
- **Document everything** - specifications prevent issues
- **Inspect and verify** - trust but verify quality

---

## Security Reminder for Product Development

**DON'T share in prompts**:
- Exact supplier names and pricing until products launch
- Proprietary techniques or processes
- Complete technical drawings with all specifications
- Unreleased collection details and timing
- Exact margins and cost structures

**DO share**:
- General design concepts and inspiration
- Material types and quality requirements
- Anonymized performance data
- Industry trends and competitive landscape
- Process flows and methodologies

**When researching**: Use general terms until product is public, then can be more specific.
